          Use this tool to find out a patient’s combined risk of catching and dying from coronavirus (COVID-19), and catching and subsequent hospitalisation from COVID-19.

          You’ll enter information about the patient including their medical history. It should take around 3 minutes to complete. The tool has been designed for use by clinicians during a consultation with a patient or as an aid to support direct care.

          The result will help you inform clinical discussions with patients about the risks if they catch COVID-19 and how they can balance those risks with their other needs. You can use the online tool to review additions to the SPL made as part of the COVID-19 Population Risk Assessment.

            Current limitations of the tool
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is based on data collected during the first peak of the pandemic. This means it cannot give an accurate result for people who are:
          </p>
          <ul
            id="service-limitations-list"
          >
            <li>
              under 19 or over 100 years old
            </li>
            <li>
              intersex or trans
            </li>
            <li>
              pregnant
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can use the tool to estimate risk for people who were advised to shield during the first wave of the pandemic, or who have a condition that qualified a person for shielding during that time, as it may inform useful discussions with patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, risk may be underestimated in this group because, when the research was being carried out, these people may have been advised to shield. This means they may have been protected from catching coronavirus and therefore severe outcomes such as hospitalisation and death.

          The tool uses QCovid®, which is a 'living' risk prediction model. This means that the model will be updated periodically when new research becomes available.
